# Pre-emptive Blackspot Warning System

## Introduction
Unmarked Road Hazards or black spots are a major cause of road accidents and fatalities. These hazards which are not properly marked like unmarked speed breakers; barricades or road diversions pose a major risk to road users. Existing reflective paint or markers suffer from environmental pitfalls such as poor visibility in rain, fog, or low light conditions. Regular wear and tear also reduces the visibility and reflective capability of these road hazard markings. To address these drawbacks, we propose a structured alert system that identifies the hazards and intimates the public based on their proximity. 

In this proposed system we have implemented geotagged IoT enabled NRF mesh nodes which update the node location to a real-time cloud database (Google FireBase) via a coordinator node and a receiver car node. These black spot node locations are then retrieved and displayed to the public based on their proximity to their current location via a mobile app which also provides alerts in real-time.

This repo deals with the Wireless Sensor Network part of the project. Will update the links to the other parts soon.
