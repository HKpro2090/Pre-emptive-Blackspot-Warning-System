# Pre-emptive Blackspot Warning System

## Introduction
In this proposed system we have implemented geotagged IoT enabled NRF mesh nodes which update the 
node location to a real-time cloud database (Google FireBase) via a coordinator node and a receiver car 
node. These black spot node locations are then retrieved and displayed to the public based on their proximity 
to their current location via a mobile app which also provides alerts in real-time. To log the data a connection 
between FireBase and the Google Spreadsheets is established. A Desktop Application acts as an interface to 
make the logged data comprehensible to the government official s and researchers. This is beneficial to the 
safety of the road users to have an advanced warning about unmarked road hazards and is effective in 
preventing road fatalities and improving overall road safety
